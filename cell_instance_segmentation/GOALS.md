<!-- Goals -->
## Goals:

I've always found kaggle fascinating but never tried to compete in a competition. 
And so, as an introduction to the Kaggle community I decided to join a competition 
and learn by doing. My goals for this competition are as follows: 

Goals:
1. Build a baseline SOTA model with miminal parameter optimization through prebuilt
libraries, in this case those libaries consist of Detectron2 and Cellpose. 
2. Explore data and make model optimizing decisions based on findings. 
3. Analize the strengths and weeknesses of current SOTA models / methods.
4. Analyze the top couple winning or any interesting submissions to get an baseline 
understanding of what I must do differently to be a strong competitor in a Kaggle 
competition.
